the castle with Eirika.[ToggleRed][A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x22][0x1]

of divine thunder when that[NL]
band of ruffians arrived.[A][NL]
Without it, I won't be able[NL]
to [ToggleRed]smite foes from afar.[ToggleRed][A][NL]

Oh, hello! Welcome to-[A][NL]
Well, I guess there's[NL]
not much here.[A]
I mean, setting up shop[NL]
middle of a mountain?[A][NL]
Who even does that?[A][NL]
[CloseSpeechFast]
Anyway, there's no secret shop[NL]
here.[A] You'll want to check[NL]
around the [ToggleRed]northwest peaks[ToggleRed].[A]

but to give you a [ToggleRed]perfect[NL]
score.[ToggleRed][A]
