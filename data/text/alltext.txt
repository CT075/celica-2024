based on how many you[NL]
found.[A][X]

in one run.[A][X]

Anyway, your goal is to[NL]
[ToggleRed]end the chapter[ToggleRed] by [ToggleRed]reaching[NL]
the castle with Eirika.[ToggleRed][A]
[X]

# # ExplainSeize

Note that [ToggleRed]reaching the castle[NL]
is enough.[ToggleRed] There's [ToggleRed]no need to[NL]
seize your own castle[ToggleRed], after[NL]
all.[A]

# # SorryLostBolting

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x22][0x1]
It's a shame, but I seem[NL]
to have misplaced my tome[A][NL]
of divine thunder when that[NL]
band of ruffians arrived.[A][NL]
Without it, I won't be able[NL]
to [ToggleRed]smite foes from afar.[ToggleRed][A][NL]
If you had [ToggleRed]arrived just a[NL]
few minutes earlier,[ToggleRed] I would[A][NL]
have had it on hand.[A]
[X]

Phew! We've seized the[NL]
castle gate![A]

our castle?[A] Why did we[NL]
need to seize it, again?[A]
[X]

[X]

# # DontSeize3

Did you think you were[NL]
being clever?[A]

Well, you were.[NL]
[X]

# # DontSeize5

[ToggleRed]But.[ToggleRed][A]

Hmm... What to do...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF]
Um...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh, hello! Welcome to-[A][NL]
Well, I guess there's[NL]
not much here.[A]
I mean, setting up shop[NL]
middle of a mountain?[A][NL]
Who even does that?[A][NL]
[CloseSpeechFast]
Anyway, there's no secret shop[NL]
here.[A] You'll want to check[NL]
around the [ToggleRed]northwest peaks[ToggleRed].[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow]
Oh yeah, take this.[A][NL]
You'll need it to[NL]
get in. Good luck![A]
[X]

# # SecretEndingDialogue

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
I'm home![A][NL]
[CloseSpeechSlow]
It was kind of Vanessa[NL]
to give me a lift, but[A][NL]
what was that thunderbolt[NL]
that struck as we left?[A][NL]
[CloseSpeechSlow]
Oh well. Time to[NL]
get some rest![A]
[X]

# # SecretEnding1

You did it! You made[NL]
it to the castle![A][X]

# # SecretEnding2

Now, you got here too fast[NL]
to have cleared any of the[NL]
[ToggleRed]hidden objectives[ToggleRed], but...[A][X]

# # SecretEnding3

I guess I have no choice[NL]
but to give you a [ToggleRed]perfect[NL]
score.[ToggleRed][A]
[X]

# # SecretEnding4

Besides, if you're seeing[NL]
this, I'd bet that you've[NL]
already beaten the map[NL]
normally, anyway...[A]
[X]

# # SecretEnding5

Now, wherever did I[NL]
leave my staff...?[A]
[X]

# # GilliamSpawn

Gilliam![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ah, Princess.[NL]
Well met.[A]
[OpenMidRight]

[OpenMidLeft]
My apologies, Princess.[A][NL]
I'm not to allow anyone[NL]
into the castle while[A][NL]
a battle of this level[NL]
rages outside.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I understand.[NL]
Stay safe![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
And you as well.[A]

Um...[A][NL]
Excuse me, have we-[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Met?[A][NL]
I'm afraid not, or at[NL]
least I'd hope not.[A][NL]
Being memorable isn't the[NL]
best quality for a spy,[A][NL]
after all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, but-[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, I'm off.[NL][A]
Time is light, foes to[NL]

You... Wait![A][NL]
I don't recognize you.[NL]
You're not one of ours.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
Whoa, easy there with the[NL]
spear, good sir![A][NL]
I'm just a humble thief[NL]
in the prince's employ![A][NL]
If you don't believe me,[NL]
ask him yourself![A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Fine.[A][NL]
Amidst all this mess, if[NL]
you wanted to betray us,[A][NL]
you've had plenty of[NL]
opportunities.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
I thank you for your[NL]
generosity, sir knight.[A][NL]

# # MatthewSecretShop

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xC][0x1]
Look, I'll tell you this[NL]
morsel of juicy gossip,[NL]
as a peace offering.[A][NL]
I hear that there's a[NL]
[ToggleRed]secret shop[ToggleRed] on this map.[A][NL]
Sounds like they have[NL]
some rare stuff, too.[A][NL]
No idea where it is,[NL]
alas, other than being[A][NL]
[ToggleRed]suspicious and out of the[NL]
way.[ToggleRed][A][NL]
[CloseSpeechSlow]
One last thing.[A][NL]
That Ephidel guy and[NL]
I...[A] We go way back.[A][NL]
So [ToggleRed]let me take a crack[NL]
at him.[ToggleRed] Please?[A]

[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x46][0x1]
Silence! If it weren't for[NL]
Hector's meddling, my master's[A][NL]
plan would have been perfect![A][NL]
But now, I am here, in this[NL]
land of Magvel![A][NL]
Can't you feel it? The power[NL]
of these [0x93]skills[0x94]?[A][NL]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xC][0x1]
Yeah, well... I've picked up a[NL]
skill or two as well.[A][NL]
One I've been dying to use on[NL]
you, actually.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x46][0x1]
